get_next_line echole 42 project
The get_next_line project at 42 School is a popular assignment designed to help students practice reading from file descriptors. The goal is to implement a function that returns the next line from a file descriptor, each time it is called, until the end of the file (EOF) is reached. It must handle any valid file descriptor, including standard input (stdin), and it typically involves careful memory management and buffer handling.
